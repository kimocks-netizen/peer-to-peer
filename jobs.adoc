== Introduction

=== Background
The purpose of the Peer 2 Peer specifications is to translate the Employeers & Employees concepts (eBusiness requirements) into specifications that enable software developers and message designers to develop the Peer 2 Peer system.

.Peer 2 Peer functional specifications goals are:
* To build a set of business objects from the Employeers & Employees concepts
* To help unempolyed people to get jobs 
* To help employeers to be able to get casual workers
* To create a smooth communication between employeers and employees


=== How it works:
=====
The purpose of this website is to help both employeers and employees to find part time workers and part time jobs, respectively. Firstly the *Employeer* will create an account & publish the time of job he is offering ( Domestic worker, Tutoring, Plumbing & Painting) and the fee he is offering to pay per hour.

The *Employee* will then login and look for a job which fits his experience. During account creation both the Employeer and the employee will create an account based on the time of a job they want to be delivered and deliver, respectively. 

The *Admin* is responsible for monitoring users, deleting accounts if the suspect any fraud.
